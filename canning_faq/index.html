			To date, no census of canners in New York state or New York City has been conducted. Much of what is known about canners comes from the canners themselves. Although their activity is made possible by a state law, canning lacks clear regulation. Canners have labored in that gray area for over 30 years, tracing unexpected routes and motley social networks that deal in the trash that most New Yorkers discard and forget.

			<div class="section_title">What is the Bottle Bill?</div>
			<div class="text_block">
				The Returnable Container Act, known as the Bottle Bill, is a statewide law was enacted in 1982 in response to an outcry over the mass of glass and plastic containers carpeting New York City’s public spaces. 
				<br><br>
				Legislators decided that by charging 5 cent deposit per container redeemable by anyone, New Yorkers would be incentivized to pick up after themselves. New York wasn’t the first state to enact a bottle bill. There are 10 states and Guam that have bottle bills with deposits ranging from 2 to 15 cents as of 2018.
				<br><br>
				In the thirty years since New York’s Bottle Bill was enacted, the state has diverted thousands of tons of recyclables into recycling facilities at no cost to local governments, used hundreds of millions of dollars in uncollected refunds to support city and state agencies, and in effect established a work-based welfare system for disadvantaged New Yorkers, known as canners.

			<div class="section_title">Who are canners?</div>
			<div class="text_block">Canners are those who supplement their income and pensions picking up cans and bottles on city streets for a redeemable value. Some of them make a living and pay a rent with the money earned canning. A small number of canners are people struggling with addiction, trying to scrape together just enough to buy a sandwich or survive. 
			<br><br>
			When the Bottle Bill first came into effect, the population of canners was much less diverse than it is now. Homeless blacks and veterans were among the first to start canning. Today, the engines of the Bottle Bill continue to be the city’s disadvantaged: Latin Americans and Chinese immigrants, the elderly, people who lost or quit their jobs, and college students all can for many reasons.</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="section_title">How many canners are in NYC?</div>
			<div class="text_block">The short answer is that we don’t know. There is no census of canners in NYC, to date. Anecdotal evidence from redemption center owners interviewed for this project estimated there are around 10,000 canners. And in an article written a few years ago, AFP also put the number at around 10,000, based on a study we were unable to verify. </div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="section_title">Why do New Yorkers can?</div>
			<div class="text_block">There is a spectrum of reasons why New Yorkers can. The common reasons are unemployment, ineligibility to work due to old age, legal status, or injury. For many elderly canners it is a means of contributing to their households and staying active. For others it’s a form of protest. It is a way to make an honest living without feeling trapped in dead-end and low-wage jobs. Sometimes it’s people looking for a quick buck. 
			<br><br>
			The one constant is that canners tend to be people who are struggling enough to see opportunity where most New Yorkers see trash.</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="section_title">How much do canners make?</div>
			<div class="text_block">Some canners make a living picking up cans and bottles. A Mexican couple featured in this project makes $40,000 a year. They work seven days a week and have a car, where they store their collection instead of going back and forth to a redemption center whenever their cart is full. A canner who works hard and with the right connections, but who has only a cart and no motor vehicle, may make about $10,000 a year. At 5 cents a container, it is not easy work. Even those who make $10 a week must find 200 cans to earn that amount.</div>
